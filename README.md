## Why I Built This Tool

Handling individual code snippets in go is a pain

1. **Organizational Overhead:** Creating a new folder for each code snippet was cumbersome. The only way to run my snippets was creating a unit test, which added further BS to the code.
2. **Limited Flexibility:** The inability to store multiple `main` functions made it difficult to quickly run different snippets without constantly modifying the same file.

Gopherit helps you streamline the process of storing, managing, and running Go code snippets.
